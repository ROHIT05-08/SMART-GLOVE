🤖 HASTVAANI
Giving Voice to the Unspoken.

🪷 What is Hastvaani?
Hastvaani — derived from Sanskrit, meaning “voice of the hand” — is an innovative wearable solution designed to bridge the gap between silence and speech.

Combining the elegance of ancient language with cutting-edge technology, Hastvaani empowers individuals — especially those with speech or hearing impairments — by converting hand gestures into real-time audio output.

With this smart glove, communication becomes inclusive, intuitive, and impactful, giving every gesture a voice that resonates.

🎯 Problem Statement
Millions of individuals with speech or hearing impairments face daily communication barriers due to the lack of accessible and real-time translation tools. Existing solutions are often expensive, bulky, or lack fluid gesture-to-speech integration.
There is a pressing need for an affordable, portable, and intuitive system that can accurately convert hand gestures into audible speech to enable seamless interaction in real-world environments.

Hastvaani addresses this challenge by delivering a sensor-driven, Bluetooth-enabled smart glove that interprets hand gestures and speaks them aloud — enabling effective communication without the need for sign language interpreters.
