# SMART-GLOVE
This smart glove is designed to assist deaf-mute individuals by converting sign language gestures into audible speech. Recognized gestures are mapped to predefined phrases, which are then spoken aloud using text-to-speech.  It promotes greater accessibility, allowing users to express themselves more freely and interact more confidently.
